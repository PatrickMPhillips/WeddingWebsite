<h1>The Ceremony</h1>
<p class="text">Amber and Patrick are getting married at the Rockafeller Chapel on the University of Chicago campus.  The reason they chose this venue was 
that they both shared a University of Chicago bond being alumini.  Patrick received his MBA from the University of Chicago Booth School of Business.  
Amber is completing her anasthesia residency this June at the University of Chicago Hospital.  Incidentally, within the first 3 months of dating, Patrick broke 
his hand and required surgury and was treated at this hospital and Amber doctored him back to health.  Rockafeller Chapel is located on the Hyde Park campus 
on the South Side of Chicago.

<h1>The Reception</h1>
<p class="text">The reception will be held at Cafe Brauer which is located on a pond right outside of the Lincoln Park Zoo.  This venue was chosen for its
outdoor feel, despite being in the heart of Chicago's Lincoln Park neighborhood.  The Lincoln Park Zoo is a free zoo where Amber and Patrick have
spent many afternoons walking around and enjoying Chicago's beautiful summer weather.

<h1>The Honeymoon</h1>
<p class="text">The honeymoon is going to be truncated slightly due to our cousin-in-law's wedding the following Saturday.  As it stands, we plan on doing a 
White Sox baseball game on the Sunday after the wedding for those who can make it.  Sunday night, we fly out to San Francisco where we will spend
the night and the next morning doing a quick tour of the city.  Monday night we will drive up to Napa Valley where will will spend the remainder 
of the week, eating, drinking, and taking it all in after a whirlwind couple of days.  That Friday we are heading down to Los Angeles for the 
wedding on Saturday.  Finally, we have to fly back to Chicago early Sunday to drive our car, our cat, and our few remaining things to Boston where
Amber starts her new role on that Tuesday after Labor Day.

<h1>Boston</h1>
<p class="text">You read that correctly: Amber and Patrick are moving to Boston.  They are (planning on) moving out of their place the week before the wedding leaving only a few necessities and their
poor cat in the apartment in the days leading up to the wedding and during the honeymoon.  Amber begins her new role as a Fellow in Boston Children's
Hospital's pediatric anathesia program.  The length of her program is one year, although she may consider a second pediatric pain fellowship which
this Hospital is known for.  Patrick will keep his role at CareerBuilder, working out of the Quincy office in South Boston.
