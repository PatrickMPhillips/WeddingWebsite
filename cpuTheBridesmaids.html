		five years old (yes Alison, we were that young!)   Amber and Alison met in their second grade class and quickly became inseparable. 
		Alison's best friend at that time did not like this and tried to beat Amber up.  Alison protected Amber and has been watching out for Amber 
		ever since.  Amber and Alison have always been troublemakers together; when they were ten they stole some Bartles and James wine coolers and 
		drank them while wearing senorita costumes in Amber's room (sorry Joyce!).  Alison and Amber are goof balls together and can have fun in almost
		any situation.  Amber's mother always told her that when she found a guy she could goof around with like Alison, he would be her husband. 
		She was right.  On a more serious note, Alison has been more than just a friend to Amber -they consider themselves sisters.  Alison graduated 
		from St. Xavier with a degree in psychology and went on to pursue a Masters degree in counseling.  She is married to her next-door neighbor from 
		childhood, Jake, and has a beautiful 2-year old daughter named Annabelle. </p></div>

		They met at the B96 B-bash that Alison invited them both to.  Amber and Christine have been very close friends ever since.  Whether living
		near or far from one another, they always kept in touch and when reunited it was as if time had never passed.   Christine is the sweetest,
		most caring, kindest friend - the year after Amber's mother passed, she hosted a special birthday party for Amber at her family's
		home so Amber would feel loved.   Amber and Christine love to go to concerts.  Christine is a huge fan of rock and roll music and
		even met Steven Tyler! The above picture is from when Amber and Christine went to the Jimmy Buffet concert - they dressed in 
		Hawaiian clothes, rented a limo, had a great time at the concert, drank many fruity drinks, and when Ivan (their Russian teenage 
		limo driver) picked them up, they promptly passed out in the back of the limo!   Christine currently works for Cooper's Hawk 
		Winery as the Director of the Wine Club.  She enjoys spending time with her parents and sisters and her two nephews and two 
		nieces. </p></div>

				<div><p class="textaboutus">Amber and Becky met through Alpha Phi sorority at the University of Illinois.  Becky and Amber became close
				their sophomore year when they both lived in the Alpha Phi house.  During the summer between sophomore and junior year, 
				Becky and Amber both stayed in Champaign for summer classes.   It was during this summer that Becky and Amber share their 
				fondest memories of: sneaking into Memorial Stadium and sitting on the 50 yard line, the 15 mile canoe trip at Turkey Run,
				sitting up until dawn on the Quad singing and dancing.  Amber and Becky lived together in the infamous apartment at 
				Daniel Towers with Cindy and Elizabeth.   After college, Becky and Amber remained close.  When Amber attended Becky's
				wedding to Nate, Amber just had to meet the attractive best man - Pat.  Since then Becky, Nate, Pat, and Amber have 
				become very close.  Becky graduated with a degree in civil engineering.  She then attained a Masters in education.  
				She recently moved with her husband Nate to Boulder, CO where they just bought their first home together!</p>

					<p class="textaboutus">Amber and Cindy met through their mutual close friend Jessica before Amber left for college at the University of 
					Illinois.  Once at U of I, Amber and Cindy reconnected.  They both joined Alpha Phi sorority and lived together in the Alpha Phi house.  
					Even though they lived in a 10 x 10 room with 7 foot ceilings, Cindy and Amber had the best time.  They lived together the summer 
					afterwards and have many great memories including their end of summer "Good As Golden" bar crawl.  Cindy, Becky, Elizabeth, and Amber 
					then lived together in the infamous apartment at Daniel Towers.  Cindy was always a great friend and when Amber took the MCAT, Cindy 
					gave her a goodie bag of food and socks with cats on them for good luck!  Cindy received a bachelors degree in accounting and then went 
					on to pursue a masters degree.  Out of college she got a job at CBIZ accounting firm.  Cindy is currently married to her husband Pat and 
					lives in Chicago.  Amber, Pat, Cindy, and Pat enjoy spending time together at Bulls games. </p>

				<div>
					<p class="textaboutus">Amber and Elizabeth met at the University of Illinois.  They both joined Alpha Phi sorority and quickly became 
					friends during their freshman year.   They had similar classes and aspirations - both were pre-med.   They lived in the sorority house 
					together and Elizabeth was assigned to sleep in the "dormer" - a large room with many beds in the attic of the house.  Elizabeth often 
					snuck down and spent time in Amber and Cindy's room instead.   Elizabeth and Amber then moved into Daniel Towers together and lived there 
					for 2 years with Becky and Cindy joining the last year. Amber and Elizabeth traveled to many places in college together including New 
					Orleans, Cancun, and the Bahamas.  Elizabeth is a true friend and was always there for Amber, especially on NYE in New Orleans when her 
					purse was stolen on Bourbon Street.   Elizabeth continued on to medical school and graduated from the University of Illinois.  She 
					completed a residency in internal medicine at Medical College of Wisconsin and is currently an endocrinology fellow at the University of 
					Kentucky.  She is married to her husband, Mike, and is expecting her first child June 2013.

					going to Mt. Pleasant to study at Central Michigan University.  She recently moved to Chicago and started at 
					CareerBuilder because she, too, wants to be like her older brother.  Laura's toughness and wit, from dealing with three obnoxious
					older brothers, has given her the ability to handle everything life has thrown at her and she has seen a ton of success 
					in her first few months in sales and in Chicago.  She has a huge heart and loves nothing more than playing with her dog
					Rocky or fussing over her nephew Jack.

				<div>
					<p class="textaboutus">Taryn is Pat's sister-in-law.  In college, Pat and his friends brought Joe to a party Taryn's roommate was throwing and that is 
		where Joe and Taryn met.  When Pat unexpectedly moved back to Dallas to finish his degree, he lived with Taryn for the semester.  Taryn, her sister Tiffy, and cousin Anna 
		have all integrated in with the Phillips clan and meet up together in Chicago and like to travel together.  Being the oldest, Joe and Taryn are 
		the ringleaders and are responsible for keeping their clans in line during tense situations, such as a single shared bathroom in Egypt when everyone present
		has food poisoning.  Taryn quickly rose up the ranks of American Airlines through sales into a Director of Cargo Operations for LAX before having
		her first born, Jackson, whom she is currently staying home to take care of.

				<div><h2>Jessica Leonard - Bridesmaid</h2></div>
				<div>
					<p class="textaboutus">Amber and Jessica met at Forestview Farms where they both used to horseback ride.  Amber and Jessica became great 
					friends bonding over their mutual love of horses.  They both also liked badminton and Amber would go watch Jessica compete in 
					championships.  Jessica also introduced Amber to skiing and took her on her family's yearly skiing trips to Devil's Head.  There they 
					would ski during the day and drink "glug" afterwards.  Jessica went away to college in the Quad cities to study geology but Amber and 
					Jessica remained close.  When Jessica returned to Oak Forest, they spent time together and Jessica became close friends with Alison and 
					Christine.   The picture of Amber and Jessica is from their trip together with Alison, Christine, and Beth to Las Vegas in May 2010.  
					This trip brought many great memories including: Beth and Jessica becoming best friends, the roll away bed Jessica was forced to sleep 
					in, and Jessica's 4 AM present from Alison and Christine.  Jessica currently resides with her boyfriend, Mark, in Ashland, Oregon where 
					she just recently bought her first home.

				<div>
					<p class="textaboutus">Amber met Beth through Alison.  Alison and Beth are both counselors and worked together at Orland Park Township.  
					Beth has an infectious sense of humor and always keeps Amber laughing.  Beth went with Amber, Christine, and Alison on their yearly trips
					to Las Vegas and many fond memories were formed there.  The best memory from Las Vegas was from the first trip.  The
					girls went to a bar called the Cat House.  There was a very attractive guy named Kyle there and he started talking to
					Beth.  They saw each other each day at the pool and exchanged information.  Over a year and a half they dated long 
					distance.  Beth and Kyle tied the knot a year and a half ago.  Sadly Beth moved away from Illinois to live in 
					Fayetteville, NC where her husband is stationed at Fort Bragg.  Amber still misses her Huey Lewis and Eddie Money 
					concert buddy, but they keep in close communication.  Beth is currently working as a counselor at one of the colleges
					and spends her downtime with her husband and black lab, Bullet. </p>
