	<br>"I was asked to be the best man at my friend Nate's wedding.  One Sunday, I met Nate and his fiancee Becky down at Nate's office where 
	they were using the scanner to put together a slide show for the wedding.  As we went through the photos, they showed me the matches that they had
	put together for their single friends.  I was supposed to meet one of their fun, driven friends who lived in New York.  However, as we went
	through the pictures, a different girl caught my eye.  When I asked about her, they said that her name was Amber, and they were going to set
	her up with Nate's cousin.  On the day of the wedding, I had made up my mind to seek out Amber and when I saw her, I knew I was going to go meet her, with
	or without Nate and Becky's help.  That night, once I had finished my best man duties, I saw her standing near the dance floor with a group of people 
	that I knew.  I worked out a game plan that I would start my talking with some of the people I knew in the group, and work my way over to introduce
	myself to her.  As I made it half-way across the dance floor, she breaks away from the group, comes right up to me and introduces herself.  We danced 
	and spend most of that night together and I got her number before we left.  That week, I called her and we set up some time to go out and talked on the 
	phone a bit.  We had our first date at XOCO and somehow in spite of my "charm" we hit it off and have been together since."</p>

			<p class="text2">Pat, or Patrick if you met him post-freshman year of college, was born in Michigan and lived in the 
same house in Grand Rapids from when he was two until he moved to Dallas for college in 1998.  From his early childhood, he was an 
avid reader; both parents tell stories of how he would come home from being away for an extended time and gather his books around 
him like they were friends that he missed while being away.  Growing up, aside from reading he spent most of his time outdoors, playing 
sports with the neighbor kids, swimming and boating with his family, building forts in the forest or sledding in the winter.  He learned 
to ski at a young age and skiing has always been one of his favorite past-times.  When he was young, his grandparents gave him his 
first cookbook which spawned another one of his passions which continues today.  In middle school he wrestled, started playing the 
alto saxaphone and football.  In high school, he continued with the marching band and football, but replaced wrestling with rugby.  
Also, in high school, Pat worked part-time at a pet food store called Chow Hound and worked as a cashier at Meijer during the summer 
of his senior year.   It was at Chow Hound that Pat worked with his friends Mike Zeeff and Andrew Fuelling.
<br>
<br>
In 1998, upon graduation, Pat moved down to Dallas to attend Southern Methodist University where he received his B.S. in Biology and 
B.A. in Chemistry.  During his summer of freshman year, Pat and his dad did a two-week homestay in Costa Rica to study spanish.  
This trip infected Pat with the travel bug resulting in an insatiable urge to run off to discover new places which he still struggles 
to control today. During college, Pat became Patrick after a year at the bar having the following conversation every night:  
"Hi, I'm Pat." "Matt?" "Pat" "Wha?" "Patrick."  Feeling the need to go back on the road, Patrick decided to try and graduate early so 
that he could spend a semester in living in Spain rather than at school.  As Patrick made his preparations and awaited his diploma, he 
received a phone call letting him know that despite having walked across the stage at graduation, due to a clerical error, he was
one class shy of graduation.  Therefore, after spending four month living abroad, Patrick returned to Dallas to finish up his degree 
and work full-time at Pappadeaux, one of his favorite restaurants.  It was during this time that Patrick rented a room from Taryn, his 
friend and his brother's long-term girlfriend. 
<br>
<br>
When Patrick graduated from college in December of 2002, for real this time, he decided it was time to go back overseas.  This time he
set his sites on the East, so he got a position teaching English in Japan for an 11-month contract that turned into 3 years.  During 
the first 18 months, he lived in a small town called Maebashi where he spent every penny(or yen in this case) traveling around Eastern 
Asia and studying Japanese.  During his final year in Japan, he moved to Tokyo to experience big-city living and lived 3 train
 stops away from Ueno Park.<br><br>
 When Patrick moved back in 2005, he decided it was time to get the proverbial hair cut and a real job and began to look for work in 
sales.  Finding little opportunity in Grand Rapids, he decided to move onto the couch in his friend Nate's apartment.  During this summer,
there were four guys living in a two-bedroom apartment with a bed in the living room and Patrick on the couch.  Patrick worked
 for the summer as a kitchen manager at a bar, Redmond's, before moving back to Grand Rapids to wait tables for about a year.  Finally, 
 he landed a job at CareerBuilder in 2007 and has been working there ever since.  At CareerBuilder, he worked in inside sales before becoming a sales manager.  
 After managing for a couple of years, he went back to school in the evenings to get his M.B.A. at the University of Chicago Booth School
 of Business.  Upon completion, he went back to outside sales for a brief stint before becoming a Product Director for Sologig, a niche 
 IT/Engineering employment website that falls under the CareerBuilder umbrella.	
 
 These days Patrick spends his time doting on his beautiful fiancee, first and foremost.  Aside from that, he still loves cooking and 
 enjoying the amazing restaurant scene Chicago has to offer.  He spent about two years practicing Taekwondo before an injury leading to 
 hand surgery curtailed that activity.  Right now, he is focusing his energy on volleyball and participating in several indoor and outdoor
 leagues and classes.  Additionally, he has signed up for a second attempt at the Chicago marathon having to drop out after a stress fracture
 the first year.  Also, he is trying to become more computer saavy and is taking online programming classes and is practicing his 
 skills by building this site.</p>
