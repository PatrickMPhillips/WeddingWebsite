<p class="text">For those who can make it, Amber and I will be going on an Architecture boat tour down the Chicago river on 
Friday the 23rd in the afternoon.  I have not actually been on said boat tour, but I hear amazing things and I see and hear them everyday when I 
cross the river on the way to work.  We will be reaching out to people and buying a bulk package of tickets for the afternoon.  The
cost is around $35 for the tour.</p>

<h1>Places to Visit in Chicago</h1>
<p class="text">Sometime around February most Chicagoans start questioning why they put up with the cold. Summertime, however, quickly
reminds them why this is one of the greatest cities on Earth.  Chicago has two speeds, winter and summer.  In summer, it is hard to find
a free weekend from all the festivals, concerts, and activities.  There is a gorgeous beach less than a 20 minute walk from downtown.  Winter
is the necessary downtime allowing you to catch up on sleep and save a little money before the weather picks up and it starts all over again.
Below are some easy sights to see while in town and a selection of our favorite restaurants.</p>

		<p class="text">What the heck is a bean?  This shiny, slightly amorphous, sculpture officially known as the Cloud Gate is located
in Millenium Park nestled between downtown and the lake in the Loop.  Although answers as to why this piece of artwork is so endearing range
from it's cute shape, to the reflective pictures which are a must, I belive it has to do with what I have termed "the Vortex."  If you have
time to see this iconic piece of Chicago, I strongly encourage you to fight the crowd to walk underneath it.  When you look straight up, while 
directly underneath the sculpture, I promise you will understand why I coined the term.		</p>

		<p class="text">While you are at the bean, check out the rest of Millenium Park.  From the beautiful Lurie Park outside of 
		the Art Institute of Chicago's modern wing, to the Crown Fountain featuring large fountains that diplay Faces of Chicago, there
		are plenty of sights within a 20-30  minute walking distance.
